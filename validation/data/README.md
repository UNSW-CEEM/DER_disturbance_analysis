# Validation datasets

For description of how to use, see the README in DER_disturbace_analysis/validation.

These data sets are currently for project MATCH/AEMO usage only. They are derived from datasets acquired under Projec MATCH NDAs with the relevant sources (Solar Analytics/Tesla).

If we want to use these elsewhere in future or make them publicly available we will need to negotiate that with the relevant parties.
