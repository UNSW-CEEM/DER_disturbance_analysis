Tool to analyse PV and DER response to System Disturbances


## Version Control

### Branching

This project uses feature branches. New features should increment minor version number once version labels are implemented.
Major version numbers will be incremented when non-backwards compatible changes are made.

### Pull requests

Branches being merged to master require Pull Requests with at least one approval.
When reviewing a pull request the following are things you can consider:
- Does the new code make sense?
- Is there enough documentation for you to understand what's going on?
- Does it match the style guide?
- Do tests have good coverage?
- Do you have any questions about how things are working?
- Do existing tests still pass?

Work is continuing on automating tests for PRs.


## Style Guide

We're planning to start using the Tidyverse style guide: https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html

The exception to this is that functions should continue to use explicit returns rather than the implicit ones in the guide.
